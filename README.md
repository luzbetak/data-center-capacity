Big Data Center Capacity Design
===============================

1. Copying user data into matrix m*n
2. Reading data from matrix m*n
3. Inserts into C++ associative containers O(log n)
4. Incrementing an iterator 0 (log n) (amortized O(1))
5. Inserts into C++ associative containers O(log n)
6. Incrementing an iterator 0 (log n) (amortized O(1))
