Big Data Center Capacity Design
===============================

1. copying user data into matrix m*n
2. reading data from matrix m*n
3. inserts into C++ associative containers O(log n)
4. incrementing an iterator 0 (log n) (amortized O(1))
5. inserts into C++ associative containers O(log n)
6. incrementing an iterator 0 (log n) (amortized O(1))
